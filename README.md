# Auristor Server Repository Setup

The auristor-repo-bionic sets up the apt configuration to enable access to
Auristor Server Repository.  The repository is not publically accessible
and requires a special APT/SSL configuration.  This package installs
everything required with the exception of the specific user certificates.
